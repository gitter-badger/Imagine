Imagine will always use the newest features from both its core language and the third party libraries its using.
It is currently planned to use Vulkan for rendering and Lua for scripting later on.

Technology    | for
--------------|---------
**C++14**     | Modern and effective C++ for the framework core
**Vulkan**    | Multithreaded rendering, shading 

## Features

This is a list of the CURRENTLY implemented features. 
The development will be focused on the renderer as soon as Vulkan comes out.

A learning module may be developed in parallel.

* Computational mathematics
  * Expression template library for linear algebra (matrices / vectors and numerical solvers)
  * Ray tracing, geometric primitives and triangle meshes manipulation
* Interactive environment
  * Cross-platform windowing and easy events handling with lambdas functions
